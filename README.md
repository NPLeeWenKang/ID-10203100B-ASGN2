## Design Process
To ensure that my website is useful to my target audience, first I would need to determine who my intended audience and users are. This would allow me to imagein and understand their point of view /  reasons to use my website, allowing me to better design the website for them.</br>
1. As a runner, firstly, I would like to know how long my runs were. Secondly, I would like some know some basic statistics about my runs. Lastly, I would like to know the weather forecast, as this allows me to better plan when and where to run.

As my website is intended for mobile and PC view, I had to design and develop my website from a "Mobile First" perspective. This means that the mobile view is always developed first, and the PC view is developed later. To ensure the website is both mobile and PC friendly, I started developing my wireframe using Adobe Xd. This allows me to "plan" my website and ensure that the PC and mobile view were suitable and appropriate.</br>

* PC version of XD wireframe: 

* Mobile version of XD wireframe: 

As said in my last Assignment (https://github.com/NPLeeWenKang/ID_10203100B_LeeWenKang_Assg01), as a IT student, I have a personal "rule" I follow. That "rule" is to always develop bit size code and always check and ensure that they contain no errors. Same as my previous assignment, I continued to follow this "rule", allowing my to troubleshoot more easily and check errors faster. As a result, I have spent lesser time debugging, and more time writing actual code.

## Features
Since this is a website catered to running enthusiast, I had to develop several features that suited their use case.

### APIs and Technologies used
1. Google Maps Javascript API:</br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview
1. OpenWeather API:</br>
https://openweathermap.org/
1. Ipapi API:</br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview
4. ChartJS:</br>
https://www.chartjs.org/
5. Bootstrap:</br>
https://getbootstrap.com/

### Website
1. Tracking distance ran:</br>
This feature allows users to use Google Map to plot their route, displaying their route's total distance. After saving their route, users revisit and veiew their route.</br>
<
2. Weather forecast:</br>
By using Ipapi API to obtain the user's country, then inputing the location into the OpenWeatherMap API, the website is able to obtain the daily weather forecast and the hourly temperature.

3. Statistics:</br>
This feature allows users to view some basic information about their runs, showing them their total time spent running, average running time and total distance traveled.

4. Login using Firebase Auth:</br>
This allows users to login using their google account. Ensuring users are able to access their account from several devices.

## Testing
Testing is a vital part in progamming and website development. It ensures that what we are building works and is functional. Therefore, comprehensive testing methods has to be in place to help expose errors<br>
### Online validators
In addition to using W3School's CSS and Markup validator service, for this assignment, I also used JSHint's Javascript validator. This allows me to ensure that my codes has no errors.
1. W3C CSS Validation Service: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
2. W3C Markup Validation Service: https://validator.w3.org/
3. JSHint Javascript Validator:https://jshint.com/
