## Design Process
To ensure that my website is useful to my target audience, first I would need to determine who my intended audience and users are. This would allow me to imagein and understand their point of view /  reasons to use my website, allowing me to better design the website for them.</br>
1. As a runner, firstly, I would like to know how long my runs were. Secondly, I would like some know some basic statistics about my runs. Lastly, I would like to know the weather forecast, as this allows me to better plan when and where to run.

As my website is intended for mobile and PC view, I had to design and develop my website from a "Mobile First" perspective. This means that the mobile view is always developed first, and the PC view is developed later. To ensure the website is both mobile and PC friendly, I started developing my wireframe using Adobe Xd. This allows me to "plan" my website and ensure that the PC and mobile view were suitable and appropriate.</br>

* Mobile version of XD wireframe: 

As said in my last Assignment (https://github.com/NPLeeWenKang/ID_10203100B_LeeWenKang_Assg01), as a IT student, I have a personal "rule" I follow. That "rule" is to always develop bit size code and always check and ensure that they contain no errors. Same as my previous assignment, I continued to follow this "rule", allowing my to troubleshoot more easily and check errors faster. As a result, I have spent lesser time debugging, and more time writing actual code.

## Features
Since this is a website catered to running enthusiast, I had to develop several features that suited their use case.

### APIs and Technologies used
1. Google Maps Javascript API:</br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview
1. OpenWeather API:</br>
https://openweathermap.org/
1. Ipapi API:</br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview
4. ChartJS:</br>
https://www.chartjs.org/
5. Bootstrap:</br>
https://getbootstrap.com/

### Website
1. Tracking distance ran:</br>
This feature allows users to use a Google Map to plot their route, displaying their route's total distance. After ploting their route, users are able to save their route, route name and timing.</br>
When developing this feature, I had to I had to use coordinates obtained from the graph to determine the distance ran. To do this, I would have to use the Haversine Formular (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula). Fortunately, Google had a blog post showing of how to implement this math formula. (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/how-calculate-distances-map-maps-javascript-api) </br>

2. Weather forecast:</br>
